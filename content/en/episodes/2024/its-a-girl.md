The aliens traveled a thousand lightyears to reach the Earth. For thousands of years they had been watching and judging the inhabitants of the blue planet from afar. Humanity had passed their test, and the time had come to invite the Earthlings to join the Stellar Federation. 

The aliens awoke from their slumber as their ship passed Mars. While they were still rubbing their eyes, an alarm sounded.

“Collision imminent!” the ship’s autopilot screamed. “Collision imminent!”

The ship lurched to the side just in time to dodge the unexpected obstacle. The aliens ran to the windows of their ship and watched a great white orb sail past them, a narrow miss.

“Luna,” one of the aliens said. “That’s what they called it. Earth’s only moon.”

“What’s it doing out here?” another alien asked.

They watched the moon grow smaller and smaller as it careened toward the red planet, destined for impact. Earth grew nearer. The ship slowed, then stopped. The aliens looked at the remnants of the third planet in silence.

Earth was split down the middle, its crust peeled back, its molten core frozen solid by the frigid temperatures of space. The atmosphere was gone. The seas were dry. The land was black and barren. Scattered among the ruins were wide swaths of color, as though the planet had been destroyed by an enormous and colorful bomb.

“Pink?” muttered an alien. “Why is it pink?”

The aliens could not look away. Some were weeping, but most were too stunned to do or say anything. Earth was gone, and so were the humans. They had arrived too late.

Hoping to find survivors, the aliens used their instruments to scan the planet for distress beacons, but they only found one signal: a repeating message coming from every Earth-radio still functioning.

“What does it say?” the ship’s captain asked.

An alien technician took off his headset and looked at the captain.

“We’ve translated it, but it doesn’t make any sense. It’s just three words.”

“Tell me,” the captain insisted.

“It’s a girl. Over and over and over. It’s a girl. It’s a girl. It’s a girl…”
